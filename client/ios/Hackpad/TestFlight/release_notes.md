## 2.1.2

- Fix for bug that caused events to not get sent properly when using the `TFOptionSessionKeepAliveTimeout` option
- Fix for bug that caused logs that were sent immediately after start session to sometimes not be sent to server

## 2.1.1

- Create sdk version that removes all access to `ASIdentifierManager`
- Add UIDevice's `identifierForVendor`

## 2.1

- Full support for the iPhone 5s’ ARM64 processor while still supporting down to iOS 4.3

## 2.0.2

- Fixed a bug where the sdk would cause an app's CPU usage to rise significantly if the device had no internet connection when the app started

## 2.0.1

- Fixed rare `8badf00d` crash in TFNetworkManager that happened when the app was in the background

## 2.0 - August 12, 2013

Improvements

- ARC
- All public TestFlight methods may be called from any thread or dispatch_queue
- All public TestFlight methods (except for `TFLog` and `takeOff:`) are asynchronous, so there is never a wait on them
- TestFlight never uses more than 1 network connection at a time
- All network traffic is grouped together, sent at once, and transferred in MessagePack. This results in using less bandwidth and less network calls.
- All network traffic if server is not reachable
- Size of SDK reduced by 70%
- New In App Update UI in an alert with landscape support. Should work for all different types of apps.
- Manual Sessions: You can manually control session start and end. See `TestFlight+ManualSessions.h` for more information
- Combining of back to back sessions. If a session starts less than 30 seconds from the last session which ended, the previous session is continued. You may change the time limit (or turn this off) using the `TFOptionSessionKeepAliveTimeout` option key.
- No longer automatically starts a session on `+takeOff:` in order to support new background modes that might launch an app in the background.
- `TFOptionReportCrashes` option to not install crash handlers
- Remove all calls to `dispatch_get_current_queue`, it is deprecated

Changes

- Removed all access to mac address
- Added AdSupport.framework requirement (as a replacement for mac address to get accurate user counts)
- Add format attribute to TFLog to show warnings for wrong format specifiers or not using a format string
- Removed Questions
- Removed Feedback View (along with backtrace option)

Bug Fixes

- Fixed addrinfo memory leak
- Fixed possible `-[TFAirTrafficController getNumberOrNilFrom:withKey:]` crash when bad data is received.
- CoreTelephony crash work around: this is a workaround of a iOS bug that causes deallocated instances of `CTTelephonyNetworkInfo` to receive notifications which causes crashes. Core Telephony is used to retrieve the device's mobile carrier.
- Fix bug with crash reporting in iOS 7
